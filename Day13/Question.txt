Question1
Design the database for a shop which sells products
Points for consideration
  1) One product can be supplied by many suppliers
  2) One supplier can supply many products
  3) All customers details have to present
  4) A customer can buy more than one product in every purchase
  5) Bill for every purchase has to be stored
  6) These are just details of one shop

Note:- you do not have to store the shop details.

Question2
Case 1: A Simple Case on ER Modelling
•	Goal – to demonstrate how to build an E-R model from a simple Statement of Objectives of a movie store. ( given very clearly in statement forms)
Scenario:
•	A video store rents movies to members.
•	Each movie in the store has a title and is identified by a unique movie number.
•	A movie can be in VHS, VCD, or DVD format.
•	Each movie belongs to one of a given set of categories (action, adventure, comedy, ... )
•	The store has a name and a (unique) phone number for each member.
•	Each member may provide a favorite movie category (used for marketing purposes).
•	There are two types of members: 
o	Golden Members:
o	Bronze Members:
•	Using  their credit cards gold members can rent one or more movies and bronze members max. of one movie.  
•	A member may have a number of dependents (with known names).
•	Each dependent is allowed to rent one (1) movie at a time.
 


Question3
( A little more abstract case )
Create an ER Diagram for a student registration system where the entities are Students, Instructors, Courses and Schedules. Consider all the possible pairings. (Given not in statements form, but in a summarized way)

Assumptions:
A student is taught by one or more Instructor
A student joins only one course
An Instructor  may teach any number of students
An Instructor takes atleast one course
A course will have only one schedule
A course may have many students
A course is taught by only one Instructor
