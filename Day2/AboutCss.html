        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
        <aside>This separation can improve content accessibility;</aside> provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        Cannot name rules
        There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.

    <p class="myStyle   ">
        Selector
        "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
        In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
